For AV209, Our world-famous stretch chinos (aka khakis) are customer favorites for a reason&mdash;several, actually.

Custom striped yarn-dyed pocket bags and an old-school coin pocket at the right hip are functional touches that just look great too. Our designers painstakingly calibrate the pitch of the pants (aka the difference between the rise in the front and back) to ensure you get a comfortable fit, every time.
